# Overview

With this program, I am starting a professional portfolio that will show my skills in various software subjects, with various projects that display said skills. 

The software firsts asks you for your name. After you enter it, a message appears saying 'Hello World! My name is (the name you just entered).'

The purpose of creating this software, was to prepare the structure of my Software Portfolio with a simple program, such as 'Hello World'.
